                <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Who are Adjustable-Rate mortgages suitable for?</h2>

                <p>An ARM mortgage may be right for you if you want lower monthly payments at the start of your loan.</p>

                <p>The ARM is a great option for those who want to quickly pay off their mortgage, live in the house for a short time, or anticipate their income increasing over the coming years.</p>

                <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">How do Adjustable-Rate mortgages work?</h2>

                <p>An ARM will provide a fixed low-interest rate for a set time, which is usually 5, 7, or 10 years. Your interest rate will fluctuate with the market and may change every six months or once per year.</p>

                <p>Your monthly mortgage payment may go up or down twice a year. However, your rate will not increase by more than 5% from the original rate.</p>

                 <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">How do I qualify for an ARM?</h2>
                    <ul class="buy-house-content-title">

                    </ul>

                <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Can you refinance an adjustable-rate mortgage?</h2>
                <p>Yes, you can refinance an adjustable-rate mortgage. Refinancing an adjustable-rate mortgage can provide stability of the same monthly payment for many years, especially when interest rates are low. Refinancing can also be a way to consolidate debt and pay down your mortgage faster.</p>
