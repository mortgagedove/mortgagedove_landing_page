                <p>Purchasing a house is a significant investment, so before looking for a house and checking mortgage rates, take some time to look at your present situation and what might change soon.</p>   
                <p>Ask these questions to yourself:</p>      
                <p style="text-indent :2em;"> 1. Are you planning major life changes such as changing jobs or building a family in the coming years that might affect your financial situation?</p>
                <p style="text-indent :2em;"> 2. Will you be committed to living in your home for at least five years?</p>
                <p style="text-indent :2em;"> 3. Do you have a steady income?</p>
                <p style="text-indent :2em;"> 4. Are you confident enough to do house repairs (or have the patience to learn) or willing to hire a professional for repairs when something goes wrong?</p>

                <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">How long should I own my house before it's paid off?</h2>
                <p>In general, we suggest that you only purchase the house if you want to reside in it for at least five years. However, this is contingent on many aspects, including the housing market, rental prices, and the amount of equity you have in the house.</p>

                    <li>There is no landlord, so you can build your home the way you like without the approval of anyone else. </li>
                    <li>In contrast to rent payments, the interest you pay with your mortgage may be tax-deductible.  </li>
                    <li>Some mortgages can be specifically tailored according to your budget and goals to prevent your monthly installment from increasing depending on the market changes</li>

                    <li>The landlord is usually the one responsible for home repairs and improvements. </li>
                    <li>You don't need to purchase homeowners insurance or be responsible for property taxes for your house.</li>
                    <li>Moving can be less stressful since you don't have to sell your house or seek renters.</li>

                <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">How to Assess Your Financial Situation Before Purchasing a House</h2>
                <p>Purchasing a house is among the largest investments you'll be making, and it's important to ensure your finance is in good shape. Begin by looking through your bank accounts and bills to assess how much you're earning and spending every month. If you're looking to purchase an apartment with another person (like your spouse), look at their financials too. </p>   
                <p>Ask yourself some questions:</p>      
                    <ul class="buy-house-content-title">
                    <li>Have you got a steady source of income or a job?</li>
                    <li>Have you set an amount of money each month in savings accounts?</li>
                    <li>Have you got a strategy to manage debt, like student loans and car loans?</li>
                    <li>Do you usually pay off your credit card debts quickly? Maintaining your credit card low will allow you to get a more favorable mortgage.</li>
                    <li>Do you have cash that you have saved to meet unexpected expenses? The best rule of thumb is to have three months of your income in savings.</li>
                    <li>Do you have money that you have saved for a downpayment and the closing cost? It is best not to use your emergency savings, or else you'll be in a difficult circumstance.</li>
                    </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="buy-house-content-title">
                <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Determining Your Down Payment</h2>
                <p>The amount you will need to make a downpayment is contingent on the type of loan and how much the house costs. Remember that the more you contribute to a downpayment, the less your monthly payments will be, and the less you'll pay on interest. Conventional loans usually require the down payment to be at a minimum of 5% of the home's value. FHA loans can be as low as 3.5%.</p>  
                <p>Alongside the down payment, you'll need to cover closing costs or fees for processing and securing your loan. They can differ based on the house cost and the kind of mortgage you choose. Usually, it's between 2% and 5% of the property's value.

            </div>
            <div class="buy-house-content-title">
                <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Get approved for a loan</h2>
                    <p>Accomplishing this before looking at houses has a lot of advantages. Here are some benefits:</p> 
                    <ul class="buy-house-content-title">
                    <li>You'll receive an approval letter that informs real estate agents and sellers that you can afford the house.  </li>
                    <li>You'll know how much you can afford to buy a house.  
                    </li>

                    <p>These are the things you can expect from your agent:</p>
                    <ul class="buy-house-content-title">
                    <li>They help you get the right house in the right place for the right price.  </li>
                    <li>They manage your paperwork.</li>
                    <li>They are the ones who negotiate with sellers. </li>
                    <li>You'll be ready for open houses as soon as you have your approval letter and listings from your agent.</li>

                <p>Home equity is the appraised value of your home less the amount you owe on your loan. Your monthly payment may be lower if you have more equity which results in a better interest rate you may get on your refinance. With enough equity, you may get rid of Private mortgage insurance (PMI). It is a monthly fee that can be added to many mortgages with a lower down payment than 20%. To check if your equity is enough to receive a lower monthly repayment, use a refinance calculator.</p>
